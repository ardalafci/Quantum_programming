# Quantum_programming
Welcome to the Quantum Programming repository! This repository contains various quantum and quantum machine learning algorithms implemented using Qiskit and Pennylane, designed for educational and practical use in the field of quantum computing. I am also using it for my university graduation thesis.


# Contents

- `Grover_Search.ipynb`: Calculates and runs the ideal number of iterations for Grover's algorithm. -Qiskit
- `K_means.ipynb`: Comparison of classical and quantum k-means algorithms. -Pennylane
- `QSVM_hybrid`: This study aimed to compare the classification accuracy of a hybrid QSVM generated using Quantum Core Trick with the performance of a traditional RBF Core Classic Kernel SVM. -Pennylane
